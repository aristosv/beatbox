Using these scripts you can create jobs in rundeck, to utilize a raspberry pi as a digital signage system. The scripts can handle playing video locally on the pi, stream or download from youtube, play audio, show a website or show a slideshow. 

There is also a script that prepares the pi, installs all dependencies, and displays a logo, when the screen is not used for showing media.

admin_prepare - prepare the pi

signage_audio - play local audio files

signage_browser - show a website

signage_images - play slideshow

signage_stop - stop signage services

signage_stream - stream youtube video

signage_video - play local video files

signage_youtube - download and play youtube video

Keep in mind I'm working on this for the learning experience. There's no warranty whatsoever that these are robust enough to be used in a production environment.
