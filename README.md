Using these scripts you can create jobs in rundeck, to utilize a raspberry pi as a digital signage system. The scripts can handle playing video located locally on the pi, stream or download from youtube, play audio, or show a website.

There's also a script that prepares the pi, installing all dependencies, and configures it to boot to a blank screen. It also displays a logo, when the screen is not used for showing other media.
