Using these scripts you can create jobs in rundeck, to utilize a raspberry pi as a digital signage system. The scripts can handle playing video located locally on the pi, stream or download from youtube, play audio, show a website or show a slideshow. 

There is also a script that prepares the pi, installs all dependencies, and displays a logo, when the screen is not used for showing media.
